## 📚 My Stack
Since I started studying the technology landscape, I've gained experience with **a few specific tools/languages**. These are **my comfort zone** _(although I'm always willing to learn more)_.
### 🛠️ Back-end
Personally, my favorite part of software development. Maybe because of my **strong relationship with C# and C**, the first languages that i've learned _(and rustic secret romance 😈)_
#### Frameworks
### 🌐 Front-end
I've always enjoyed creating beautiful and useful things. Because of this, I also have a certain domain with front-end development. Using my knowledge of UX/UI.
#### Frameworks
### 🔧 General Tools
Given the complexity of **creating an automated solution**, I had to learn some specific tools that can be applied in various contexts.
